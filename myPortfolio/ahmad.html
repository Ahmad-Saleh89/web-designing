        <h2>Who is Ahmad Saleh?</h2>
        <div class="bio-content">
          <p>I am a Syrian, moved to the United States in late 2013.</p>
          <p>since 2016 I have opened my eyes into the programming world. I started my journey with learning C programming language by taking an Introduction to Computer Science Course (CS50) via Edx.org. Later on, I started learning the basics of Java and Iâ€™ve gotten hooked to programming ever since.</p>
          <p>As 2017 began, I have passionately learned how to build a website using modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and in order to keep my work organized I got myself familiar with the Command Line &amp; GitHub where most of my codes and my practice can be found. I have also extended my knowledge by learning Bootstrap, SASS &amp; Jquery and started using them to write clean and maintainable codes.</p>
          <p>Due to the fact that I am the type who likes to stay ahead of the curve, I have been lately focusing on expanding my skills by adding WordPress, PHP and Angular to my skillset.</p>
          <p>I have been working at Bryan LGH in Lincoln, NE since March, 2015 as a Pharmacy Technician.</p>
