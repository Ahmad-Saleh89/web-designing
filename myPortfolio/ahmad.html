          <h2>Who is Ahmad Saleh?</h2>
          <div class="subject">
            <p>I am Ahmad Saleh, from Syria. I moved to the United States in August, 2013 and I have resided in Lincoln, NE. </p>
            <p>I’m a twin of a lovely sister. We are the youngest of eight siblings family.</p>
            <p>Arabic is my first language, I speak English fluently and a little of Turkish.</p>
            <p>Because of the conflict that had taken place in Syria since 2011, I had to leave Syria in late 2012 and relocated in Amman, Jordan. In Jordan I worked as a Pharmacist for a few months. During my staying in Jordan I learned a lot of things; I learned how to become more reliable and independent, I learned how to learn from my mistakes, I learned that in order to success I have to love what I do, and most importantly I learned that being a Pharmacist is NOT what I want to do for the rest of my life.</p>

          <h2>Moving to United States</h2>
          <div class="subject">
            <p>In August of 2013 I moved to the United States carrying all my dreams and ambitions hoping to begin a new and yet a prosper future.
              The first year and a half here in the US I was focusing on improving my English, socializing and getting immersed in the American culture.
              <br>I took some English classes at the University of Nebraska Lincoln UNL as well as some online Algebra and Calculus courses, preparing myself to change my entire career and to explore a different field.
              <br>I also used to work (on campus) few hours per week while I was a student at UNL.

          <h2>So why web development??</h2>
          <div class="subject">
            <p>
              Well, simply, with all due respect, I didn’t like being a pharmacist. <br>
              With that in mind, I wanted to cultivate in a different field.
              A field where creativity takes place and dominates.
              A field where challenges are being defeated. And what’s better
              than Web Development field to fulfill my desires.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, I couldn’t afford going to school for Computer Science major.
              However, that did not restrain me from pursuing my dreams because I have always
              believed that knowledge is not confined in classrooms. In fact, Knowledge can be
              reachable and accessible and sometimes even with no cost at all.
              All what it is needed to be knowledgeable is determination and perseverance.

          <h2>Stepstone </h2>
          <div class="subject">
            <p>To support myself financially, I got a job as a full time
              Pharmacy Technician at Bryan LGH Lincoln, NE on March of 2015
              and I have been doing so ever since.
            </p>
            <p>As a team player and a self-motivated individual,
              I highly believe that success can be earned much faster when
              having a healthy relationship with my managers and my coworkers.
              A relationship where collaboration and motivation are its essential elements.

          <h2>How did I start in web development?</h2>
          <div class="subject">
            <p>
              It all started in the early  2016 when I enrolled in the CS50 course,
              introduction to Computer Science (Harvard University) via Edx.org Platform.
              I learned the basics  of C programming language.
              Later on, I learned the basics of Java via Lynda.com. At that point,
              I got a decent understanding of how a computer thinks.
              And I’ve gotten hooked to the programming world ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
              As 2017 began, I have passionately learned how to build
              a website using modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
              I successfully completed HTML, CSS and JavaScript for
              Web Developers Course (John Hopkins University) via Coursera platform.
              After that I kept expanding my experience by taking several courses
              via Khan Academy, FreeCodeCamp, Lynda.com, Udemy, Udacity,
              and numerous YouTube courses and tutorials.
            </p>
            <p>
              And in order to keep my work organized; I got myself familiar with the Command Line & GitHub.
              I have also extended my knowledge by learning Bootstrap, SASS & jQuery.
            </p>

              have paid off. ahmad-saleh.com is hand coded by me, I have spent hours and hours with nontrivial amount of coffee,
              building every brick and taking care of every corner and every aspect of it.
            </p>
            <p>With multiple challenges I have faced while building my site,

          <h3>I choose coding not because it is easy, because it is hard!</h3>

          <h2>Will I stop here?</h2>

            <p>
              Definitely Not. My goal is to become a full stack web developer.
              In the meantime I am developing my current skills as well as adding new ones as I go.
              I believe it is only a matter of time to get proficient at
              WordPress, PHP, Angular, Photoshop and the list goes on and on.
